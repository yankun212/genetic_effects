##Rare and abundant bacterial communities in poplar rhizosphere soils respond differently to genetic effects 

- This project contains the source code from the manuscript."Rare and abundant bacterial communities in poplar rhizosphere soils respond differently to genetic effects "

- Documents ended with **.R** are the main R script for the corresponding analyses. Those ended simply with **.r** are required functions. Those ended with **.csv**, **.tre**, **.txt** etc. are required datasets.

- "code.R" contains the main codes of this study. "hub_node.r" is a necessary function for computing the hub node.

###The main code includes:
- Fig.1F: Differences in community structure between family groups as demonstrated by CPCoA. 
- Fig.1G: the contribution of genetic effects and soil environmental factors to bacterial community structure. 
- Fig.2: Screening for rare and abundant taxa
- Fig.3A: Ternary plot representing the distribution of ASVs between progenies and their parents.
- Fig.5: The co-occurrence networks,hub nodes and Network robustness
- Fig.6A: Dispersal-niche Continuum Index between groups  
- Fig.6B: Community assembly analysis NTI, BNTI and RC_bray
